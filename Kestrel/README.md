## Example of Embedding Kestrel and using SignalR in an Excel xll

This example is a proof of concept. 


To Build the example you must **publish** it not just build it. This is because you need the framework dlls next to the addin dlls.

The example is setup for 64bit Excel, you may have to set it to x86 if you are using 32bit Excel.
